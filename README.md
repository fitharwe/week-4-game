Crystal Game

This game is a guessing game that resets after each win or loss.

To play, you will be given a random target number at the start of the game. There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal you will add an unknown amount of points to your
total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the target number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the target number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the values of each crystal and the target number will change.

This can be run in a standard web browser. Contributions can be pushed to this github.
